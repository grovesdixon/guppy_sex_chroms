#complete the steps in guppy_sex_chrom_notes.txt


#RNA-seq:
#send all_featureCounts_geneCounts.tsv from section 'GET GENE COUNTS WITH FEATURECOUNTS' to guppy_sex_chroms/rnaseq/ in repo

initialize_feature_counts.R
	#read in and format the feature counts results and plot overview figures

deseq_sex.R
	#get sex differences within species
	#(loading files to load and format data for M:F comparisons within species are in sex_compare_groups/)

deseq_species.R
	#get species differences within sexes
	#(loading files to load and format data for ancestral comparisons (species:species within sexes) are in species_compare_groups/)


#DNA:
#send all_multicov_results.tsv from section 'FOLD COVERAGE FROM DNA' to guppy_sex_chroms/dna/fold_coverage
	fold_coverage.R
		#format and explore the coverage data
 
 #send the *100Kb_win_res.tsv files from section 'MALE FEMALE DIFFERENCES' to guppy_sex_chroms/dna/vcf_windows
 	plot_vcftools_windows.R
 		#format and explore the vcfwindow wrapper results.
 

#Both DNA and RNA:
#send the *ylikeDepths.tsv and *ylikeFinal.recode.vcf files from section 'CALL PUTATIVE W- AND Y-LINKED ALLELES' to guppy_sex_chroms/both_dna_rna/callXY
	
#use the format_spp.R files to format the names of each species from these files (this was a pain)
	y_like_density.R
		#use this to explore the density of Y-like SNPS
	explore_xy_expression.R 
		#explore the X and Y allele coverage


#Final figure plotting
	plot_figure1.R
		plot similar figures to figure 1 in Darolti et al. 2019
	
	plot_figure2.R
		similar stuff to figure 3 from Darolti et al. 2019
	
	plot_snp_pcas.R
		plot PCAs based on the SNP data
	
	plot_ge_pcas.R
		plot PCAs based on the gene expression levels
